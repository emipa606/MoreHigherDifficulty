--- Original Description ---
Add 3 difficult difficulty levels more than Merciless.


· Insane
It is difficult difficulty that is more difficult than Merciless.
It is recommended for people who cleared extremism many times.


· Despair
Crops that are not overwhelmingly growing, research that does not progress, mental conditions of settlers that are too brittle ...
In an environment that is overwhelmingly more severe than Merciless, it plagues players.
It is recommended for those who want a story that does not end without sacrifice, or who wants to challenge a mighty difficulty.


· Despair+
In addition to Despair, several unreasonable events are taking place. Only those who want to taste unreasonableness.
